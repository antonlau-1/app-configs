### Zsh

My zsh setup is basic. I use oh-my-zsh for configuration. The main 2 plugins I use are fzf (fuzzy search) and git

### Tmux

I use Tmux as my terminal multiplexer. It offers a wide-range of capabilities such as panes/tabs management, save states, and good integration with nvim.

### Nvim

This is the editor of choice for me in terms of extensibility. I use LUA to setup a variety of plugins like Telescope and NERDTree for easy navigation.
